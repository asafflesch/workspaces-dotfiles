- Use "bzl" instead of "bazel" for all commands that need bazel
- Whenever creating a branch, prefix with "asaf.flescher/"
- Unless the change you're being asked to make is explicitly about adding tests, don't mention test coverage in commit messages or PR descriptions
- Never do "git add .". Always add files explicitly to a commit
